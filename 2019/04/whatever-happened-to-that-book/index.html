<p>Whatever happened to that book you were writing?—is not a question I have been asked too many times. You see, I am not a well-known writer at all—but I digress. I have in fact, been working for a while on at least two, maybe two and a half books—none of which are actually ready yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>an untitled poetry book <em>(in Sinhala)</em></li>
<li>an untitled sci-fi novel <em>(in English)</em></li>
<li>an untitled poetry <em>maybe</em> chapbook <em>(in English)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If—for whatever unfathomable reason—you wish to know more about what has been happening with these, you might like this update. Let me start with what is closest to being complete.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h1 id="untitled-poetry-book-sinhala">Untitled poetry book (Sinhala)</h1>
<p>Eventhough I work in technology—and am very passionate about that—there are other aspects of my life. One of those involves poetry, to the point I would say I am as much poet as I am geek.</p>
<p>Taking quite a bit of liberty with the term &ldquo;poetry&rdquo;, I have been writing poetry since I was in grade school. More importantly, I always felt free the most when I was left in my mind to mind my own. Given a pen and a blank page—like many that came before me—I turned to writing, and poetry was my first choice of a medium.</p>
<p>Somewhere, roughly around fifteen years ago, I naively thought I had enough poems to compile into a book. While I did not have any need of getting published—just a dream—I just wanted to put things into a form.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, fifteen years is a long time—specially if you are practising a form of art. I definitely am not the same person I used to be—nor is my art. My values have changed quite drastically, and some firmly believed ethos—I have shed without leaving a trace. More importantly I got to read tons of poetry from around the world.</p>
<p>As a result, I did something to my old writing. To borrow an action from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Paustovsky">Paustovsky</a>, and from one of my own poems (roughly translated):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I set the field of paper flowers on fire<br>
 so that none may see&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did that in the most literal way possible. I discarded most of my old writing without any guilt or remorse whatsoever. As the papers burn, I felt the weight of being associated with them lift off my shoulders.</p>
<p>Today, I am much more closer to a book of poetry than I have ever been. I worked without any time lines to keep. So I took my time. The funny thing is, there might be a chance that I never quite finish them. Even now, I find myself editing the words of a poem I had written years ago. I am actually hoping that the time would be soon because the more I delay, bigger is the risk of me taking a flame to this particular collection of papers as well.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, I think there soon would be a time when I decide, that it is as good time as any to take a snapshot of my words, and call it a book. Who knows, it might even get published.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h1 id="untitled-sci-fi-novel-english">Untitled sci-fi novel (English)</h1>
<p>I had not really written anything this ambitious on longer formats. I once tried to write a fiction in Sinhala, a long time ago, and managed to have fun writing the first act. Then I realized a couple of things. First, it was going to end up a short story—which was fine. But the next realization was a much more severe blow. I felt I was writing a derived story. It was not a plagiarized plot, but it felt like something anyone has heard before. And, that proved to be the end of it.</p>
<p>I cannot really remember where the initial spark came from. But there is a story unfolding in my mind. Somewhere in November, 2016, I started writing it down—bits and pieces, from here and there.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Something I&#39;ve been working in my free time for the past month. Putting it out there so that I commit. No dates. But guess I&#39;m doing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/this?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#this</a>. <a href="https://t.co/mANc5QJO8c">pic.twitter.com/mANc5QJO8c</a></p>&mdash; Gaveen Prabhasara (@gaveen) <a href="https://twitter.com/gaveen/status/814444496939347969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>When I started working on this sci-fi/fantasy novel, I not only started having a ridiculous amount of fun figuring out how the story was unfolding, but I also found the <em>need</em> to write. It felt like a story no one else would write, it felt like a story only I could write. Every time my inner critic felt, &ldquo;that bit is not that great&rdquo;, my sense of wonder kicked-in, enthusiastically saying things like: &ldquo;Well, you are the one creating it! Make it awesome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right around the time I was carefully climbing down that euphoric high, a few stars happened to align just the wrong way. For one, I got supper busy with work, where I had to juggle three different full-time job roles.</p>
<p>Then, I embraced anime and pretty much gave up on TV shows (with the occasional exception on Netflix). Previously I had only watched anime which were special to me (e.g., Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden) or were rated as some of the all-time best (e.g., Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Psycho-Pass, Death Note, Attack on Titan). I eventually fully understood that anime is not a genre, but rather a medium. I started venturing outside my comfort zone to watch anime that had not been rated yet, or were lesser known, or did not sound like something I would normally enjoy. This proved to be amazingly rewarding as I got to watch some amazing shows (e.g., Made in Abyss, Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, The Promised Neverland, Mob Psycho 100, etc.).</p>
<p>I digress, again. The point is—having being exposed to an entire medium of storytelling—I gained a new perspective about storytelling, at the same time becoming painfully aware how clichéd some of the plot devices which I had previously thought innovative going by western media standards. This was a lesson for me. I never underestimated anime, but I had overestimated what I thought as good storytelling.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(film)">Black Panther</a> happened. It is easy to overlook it as just another superhero film leading up to the next Avengers film. But as an outsider and a person of color, I could see Black Panther checking so many boxes I felt had been left unchecked for too long—things such as colored protagonists, colored characters in their native settings, celebration of their cultures, garb, music, etc., lack of white-saviors or white-narrators, etc. Black Panther may have been yet another superhero movie, but there is no denying how big a breakthrough it was. It made me happy and left me somewhat satiated for a while. I felt, at least a part of what I set out to do had been achieved—probably far better than I ever could. So I did put the book on hold indefinitely, even though not entirely deliberately.</p>
<p>The good news is, I am going to tell the story I have. I will keep working on it and I will keep writing. In fact, I quite recently figured out a key driving point which I had not been able to nail-down before. The world-building is not entirely complete, some of the character arcs are not fully developed yet, I still do not know how some of the plot points in the middle gets worked out, but the story is unravelling—and, I fully intend to write it.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<p> </p>
<p>As there is not much else to say about the poetry chapbook (in English) other than it may or may not become a thing, I will leave a bit of early details about the novel as a token of my appreciation for reaching this point in the post.</p>
<p>The novels&rsquo; setting will be in South Asia—Sri Lanka and adjacent area to be a little more specific. The names of the two main protagonists start with R and A. It generally fits into sci-fi/fantasy classification. The novel will be the first book (out of perhaps three), but that is just for me to structure things. I am only going to work on the first book. The rest will follow, if they do.</p>
<p>There will be no time line plans, but it is also not something &ldquo;someday, eventually&rdquo; either. I will keep working on it, and it will be ready when it is. When it is, I will keep you posted.</p>
