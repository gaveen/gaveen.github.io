            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Not many people have contacted me asking things about this blog. So, I&rsquo;m placing these fabricated questions here to tell you a little more about a few things.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you-anyway">Who are you anyway?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Gaveen. The site introduction says I&rsquo;m a <strong>SysAdmin, Programming Language Tourist, and Petty Dabbler of the Written Word</strong>, among other things.</p>
<p>My Twitter profile says I&rsquo;m into Science, Technology, Open Source, Linux, Poetry, and Mechanical Keyboards.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-full-name">What is your full name?</h2>
<p><strong>Gaveen Prabhasara de Silva</strong>. Being Sri Lankan, there are definitely more parts to my name, but this fits well enough into the first/middle/last-name convention. Besides, do you need even more hard-to-pronounce names in your life?</p>
<h2 id="are-there-more-navigation-options">Are there more navigation options?</h2>
<p>Yes. Currently the site content is organized into main categories, while each post may have tags.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/categories/"><strong>Categories</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="/tags/"><strong>Tags</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-i-subscribe-only-to-a-section-i-like-in-this-blog">Can I subscribe only to a section I like in this blog?</h2>
<p>Yes. Each of the categories and tags will have its <strong>own RSS feed</strong>. Just append an <em>&lsquo;index.xml&rsquo;</em> to the URL to get the relevant feed URL. For example, if you want to subscribe only to <a href="/tags/devops/index.xml">posts with <code>devops</code></a> tag, you can do so.</p>
<h2 id="how-was-this-site-made">How was this site made?</h2>
<p>This blog is currently built as a <a href="https://github.com/gaveen/gaveen.github.io">static site</a> using <a href="https://gohugo.io/"><strong>Hugo</strong></a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/"><em>GitHub Pages</em></a>. Current theme in use is a slightly modified version of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/"><em>Hello Friend NG</em></a> by <a href="https://atlialp.com/"><em>Djordje Atlialp</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="have-i-seen-this-site-elsewhere-before">Have I seen this site elsewhere before?</h2>
<p>Unlikely, but not impossible. This site was initially hosted on <em>Medium (2017-2018)</em> and later on <em>Svbtle (2019)</em> services respectively before finally being moved to <em>GitHub Pages (2020)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-was-it-moved-away-from-those-previous-services">Why was it moved away from those previous services?</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the direction Medium was going, which is why I first moved to Svbtle. If you want minimalist features and a blogging service which gets out of your way, I still can recommend <a href="https://svbtle.com/">Svbtle</a>. However, I needed just a little more customization than what Svbtle offered, hence here we are.</p>
<h2 id="have-i-read-some-of-these-posts-elsewhere">Have I read some of these posts elsewhere?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible. Right now, this is not syndicated as far as I know. However, I have re-posted selected tech-related posts on my <a href="https://dev.to/gaveen">dev.to profile</a>. For example, <a href="https://dev.to/gaveen/my-vim-story-594d">My Vim Story</a>.</p>
