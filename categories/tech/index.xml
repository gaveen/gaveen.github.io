      <description>If you have worked in a command line at some point, I am sure you can praise the wisdom of learning how to use a text editor. On Unix/Linux command lines, text is king and learning how to manipulate text effectively goes a long way for productivity. If you know how to open a file and edit its content, that enables you to configure your system.
I have been using Linux for a long time—even on my desktop/laptop system.</description>

      <description>I have always been a believer in Cloud Computing. Even when big executives of the world were calling it a fad, I believed in the cloud—or its promise. It was not so much an achievement to be had—rather as with to so many other people in tech—it spoke to me from a place of understanding. We may not have called it &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;, but when Amazon opened the gates of their Web Services to everyone, we saw good things we recognized with and we realized it was an opportunity to build things better.</description>

      <description>I believe the future of networking is software. To be a little more specific on my thoughts, I believe the future of networking in the data center is software-based. Water is wet, and on that note, thank you for coming to my TED talk. And, quick PS: clouds are also hosted in data centers.
While what I just mentioned maybe obvious to say—given how pretty much everything has its future in software—you would be surprised at the state of the networking industry if you came to it as an outsider.</description>
