      <description>If you have worked in a command line at some point, I am sure you can praise the wisdom of learning how to use a text editor. On Unix/Linux command lines, text is king and learning how to manipulate text effectively goes a long way for productivity. If you know how to open a file and edit its content, that enables you to configure your system.
I have been using Linux for a long time—even on my desktop/laptop system.</description>

 Are there more navigation options? Yes. Currently, site content is organized into main categories while each post may have tags.
 Categories Tags   Can I subscribe only to a section of this blog? Yes. Each of the categories and tags will have its own feed.</description>

      <description>Today is the Sinhala (and Tamil) New Year day. As I sit in front of the computer to partake in my trade—as one does according to tradition—I want to try an answer a certain question.
Whatever happened to that book you were writing?—is not a question I have been asked too many times. You see, I am not a well-known writer at all—but I digress. I have in fact, been working for a while on at least two, maybe two and a half books—none of which are actually ready yet.</description>

      <description>Where should I begin? Is this on?
Hello there! Welcome, fellow human being, and of course, any other that is reading. This is presumably Gaveen, and—despite all my efforts—you have found my blog. If this is the choice of Steins;Gate, who am I to complain.
There are no grand introductions here, nor any road maps to unveil—just the simple realization to be had that I may have moved my blog yet another time.</description>
