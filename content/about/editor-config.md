In the future, I might keep an up-to-date page here explaining my text editor configuration (including plugin selection), both for posterity and as a hopefully helpful source of information.

## Vim

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) has been my preferred text editor for a long time. Since there is already [a reasonably detailed blog post](https://gaveen.me/2020/02/my-vim-story/), I'll point to it until there is a significant change.

## Neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a more modernized variation of Vim (kind of like how Vim was an upgrade to Vi). I use Neovim (nvim) as my preferred coding editor since is has everything Vim has and much more. For example, better syntax handling, better Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) client integration, better code completion, etc.

My Neovim setup is tracked in a git repository: [Neovimfiles](https://github.com/gaveen/neovimfiles)

## Helix

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is an alternative text editor I'm trying for the command line. It's a fast, modern text editor written in Rust. Since it comes with batteries and a vim-like default keybinding, I'm keeping track of how it improves over time.

## Obsidian

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) extensively as my notes application. While I don't consider any software as my core utility unless it's open source, Obsidian is the exception to that rule. This is because, even if I stop using Obsidian today, all my notes are still available as plain Markdown files.

I used different plugins for different vaults. However, figuring out my notes system without making it an additional overhead took some work. Therefore, I hope to document it briefly (soon).
