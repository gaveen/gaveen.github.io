One of my hobbies/special interests is Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboards and Keyboard Layouts that go with them. I'll use this page (soon) as an up-to-date place to explain how I have configured my custom ergonomic keyboard setup.

## ID75

Until this page is ready, I'll link the GitHub [repo with my custom keyboard configuration](https://github.com/gaveen/dotfiles/tree/master/keyboards).
