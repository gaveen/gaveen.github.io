I'm *Gaveen Prabhasara de Silva,* a SysAdmin, Programming Language Tourist, and Petty Dabbler of the Written Word. I am also neurodivergent and a father.

I started using Linux more than twenty years ago and never looked back. I've helped companies ranging from startups to multi-national telcos to run Linux and IT infrastructure (and later cloud infrastructure) for almost that long. I am an open source software advocate, looking forward to contributing to open source projects outside of the community aspects. 

My white-collar pitch is that I am a results-driven Engineering Manager with 10+ years of experience leading cross-functional teams to deliver complex engineering projects from web applications to data center infrastructure—working on Asura Linux in my free time. In the past ten years, I helped my current employer build a TIA 942 and ISO 27001 certified Tier 3, high density, and service provider agnostic commercial data center—a first in Sri Lanka in many categories. I was the project coordinator of this initiative from the concept stage, later becoming the first employee and currently managing its engineering operations. I was also the project owner for several critical projects like data center networking, IT systems, and ISO certification—while managing IT operations, compliance, pre-sales engineering, product innovation, and service provider/partner relationships functions.

While I have a lot of interests that can take up my attention from time to time, my more prominent areas of interest include systems engineering, writing, music, DIY/craftsmanship, science/technology, anime, mycology, and cooking—among other things. It doesn't mean I am good at most of these things, just that I'm interested in them.
