I'm *Gaveen Prabhasara de Silva,* a sysadmin, programming language Tourist, and petty dabbler of the written word. Some people know me as a technologist, some as a poet/writer, some as an artist, and some as a tinkerer—all valid aspects of my life. I am also neurodivergent and a father.

I have a lot of interests that can keep me engaged to varying degrees from time to time. My more prominent areas of interest include systems engineering, writing, music, craftsmanship/DIY, open source, science/technology, anime, arms, mycology, and cooking—among other things.

It doesn't necessarily mean I am good at these things, just that I'm interested in them. I can also be interested in some things in unusual ways. For instance, I'm fascinated by all sorts of polearms, even though I'm a pacifist. I like making all kinds of mechanical keyboards but only like using ones built for better ergonomics. I can go on and on for hours about my interest, but this isn't the place for that.

My elevator pitch—for those looking for one—is that I am a results-driven Engineering Manager with 10+ years of experience leading cross-functional teams to deliver complex projects from web applications to data center infrastructure—working on Asura Linux in my free time.

I started using Linux more than twenty years ago—and never looked back. Over the years, I've helped companies ranging from startups to multi-national telcos run Linux systems and IT infrastructure (and later cloud infrastructure) for almost that long. I'm a life-long learner who believes in open source and collaboration for the common good.

In the past ten years, I helped my current employer build and operate a TIA 942 and ISO 27001 certified Tier 3, high density, and service provider agnostic commercial data center—a first in Sri Lanka in many categories. I was the project coordinator of this initiative from the concept stage, later becoming the first employee and currently managing its engineering operations. I was also the project owner for several critical projects like data center networking, IT systems, and ISO certification—while managing IT operations, compliance, pre-sales engineering, product innovation, and service provider/partner relationships functions.
