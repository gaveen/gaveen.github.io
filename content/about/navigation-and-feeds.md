## Links and RSS Feeds

Since this site is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), RSS feeds should be supported everywhere. All you have to do is to append a `/index.xml` to the URL of a relevant section.

| Section | Link | RSS Feed |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Main** | [gaveen.me](https://gaveen.me/) | https://gaveen.me/index.xml |
| **Sections** | [Blog Posts](https://gaveen.me/posts) | https://gaveen.me/posts/index.xml |
|  | [About](https://gaveen.me/about) | https://gaveen.me/about/index.xml |
