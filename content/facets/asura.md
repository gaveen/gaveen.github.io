I started **Asura Linux** as a new Open Source project to experiment with different ways of building and running modern general-purpose Linux systems—and to share what we learn along the way.

In other words, I want to experiment with different ways of building and running Linux systems. My reasoning is simple—I want to build the Linux user experience I want to use.

While the "what I want to use" is always a moving target, there have been enough exciting recent developments in the Linux world that shed preconceived notions about how Linux distributions are put together.

## Asura Linux

Asura Linux is not trying to build a derived customization of an existing Linux distro. It will take an experimental approach to research and develop around a set of technologies and concepts.
