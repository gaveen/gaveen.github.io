**Mayavee** is a humble little idea that—driven by its values—smaller-scale research with a practical approach can effect meaningful improvements.

Mayavee both encompasses ideas to explore and the values to explore them with. The inspiration behind Mayavee is that positive impact may come from the most humble of circumstances.

In addition, I rely on Mayavee Values as my guiding values whenever I create a new project venture that I feel worthy of exploration.

## Values

We will be responsible participants in society and the environment.
