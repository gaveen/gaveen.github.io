Hey, it's been a while. How have you been? Four years is a long time.

In my defense, a lot happened in those four years. There are already a million posts and podcasts about what the world went through during that time. There are at least a few about what people in Sri Lanka had to deal with. So, I won't go there. At least not now.

At the moment, all I want to say is, here I am now. I want to write more often. Scratch that. I certainly want to post more often. I do write often. Just not the kind of thing I feel most would find interesting enough to read. In my past blog configuration, I had to complete several manual steps to publish a post after I was done writing. While it wasn't particularly taxing, it usually became the straw that broke the back of the camel that was a new blog post. I can't recall how many posts I left as drafts and eventually discarded.

In addition, those few years were an apt time to be active on *Twitter*. While the blog always felt the best for long-form content, Twitter was for sharing intriguing technical articles and arguing with random strangers. Other times, Twitter was for news, emergency, activism, or political dissent. It was a time like that. But it's gone now. Our so-called digital town square was bought by an incompetent mayor. Twitter of the old days is no more. While I lost touch with some, most people I wanted to hear from switched to the fediverse around the same time as I. Mastodon is usually a more chilled space and a welcome change of pace. However, what's happening with things like Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere is a reminder to own a place for your voice.

I've also personally grown a bit during these few years. Granted, I have to grow up in my role as a father, along with my child. But that's not exactly what I meant. Over the past couple of years, I was lucky enough to notice a few toxic traits I had picked up over time and started to be better. Some were straightforward to notice, but others came because of a more profound shift.

Last year, I met my true self for the first time. There's no way I can claim something as huge as that and walk away without elaborating. Due to several reasons, I can't go into specific details just yet. I promise I'll elaborate in way too much detail in due time. What I can share right now is that I am *neurodivergent*. That means I experience and process the world somewhat differently than most people.

No two people think exactly the same or have psychological experiences exactly alike. That's not what I meant. *Neurodiversity* is the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in fundamentally different ways. There is no single right or wrong way. Therefore, those who don't form a majority commonality (i.e., neurodivergent) don't have inherent deficits.

However, since our world around us is built around the commonality of such experiences, people who aren't *neurotypical* may be affected differently by the world. They can appear to have issues with seemingly mundane things while excelling at things neurotypical people don't find intuitive. That doesn't sound overly complicated, right?

If that sounded like a segue to go on a tangent, that's because it was. There might come a time when neurodiversity is acknowledged and celebrated as other forms of diversity. But we're not there by a long shot. 

There are disabled people in all neurotypes. And, people who are not of the majority neurotype can be disabled by a world that wasn't developed for them. However, trying to classify people only through a pathologized interpretation of their existence is exceedingly reductive—and insulting. Unfortunately, that's where we are. The current status of affairs translates to a majority being uncomfortable acknowledging the different existences of people without pathologized descriptors—and people with a diagnosis for such descriptors being uncomfortable accepting others like them without a formal diagnosis of autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.

Then, there are the invisible neurodivergent people. They are people like me who can mask their differences—often without even knowing they are doing so. Since they learned how to behave—a vital survival skill—by masking their differences, the masked behavior might even be the only behavior they have. For such people, both their differences and difficulties are usually invisible to everyone else. It is assumed that most masking neurodivergent people don't know the depth of their differences. Even when they notice, they are more likely to suspect psychological reasons or assume everyone else is also going through the same struggle. When things boil over as meltdowns and burnouts, their struggles are often viewed as personal defects rather than the effects of masked neurodivergence.

We (the human race) are only beginning to understand neurodiversity better. We're only now beginning to see just how many masking neurodivergent people could be out there. Therefore, for most neurodivergent people, social media is the only way to learn from a diverse pool of lived experiences of people like them. A vast majority of neurodivergent people don't watch a few video clips and claim disability benefits or use them for online clout. They connect the dots, then spend months and months guessing and second-guessing if they could have autism, ADHD, etc. They research every bit of information they can find and study (that particular subject), probably harder than the average medical professional. As a result, more people are gradually becoming aware of their neurodivergence and starting to self-identify.

If you see random people being angry about "Autism/ADHD social media trends" and "TikTok diagnosis," this is what they are uncomfortable about. I'm sure some people could mistake—or even go as far as to fake—having such a condition. But that's not the vast majority. Besides, no one can diagnose from social media posts, even if they can experience that different existence in the first place. On the flip side, when faced with the reality of neurodiversity, some people resort to harmful misinformation like "everyone is a little autistic"—merely to invalidate a neurodivergent existence.

It makes me profoundly sad whenever I think about how many generations upon generations of neurodivergent people struggled their entire lives without ever knowing why or how to articulate their existence. Therefore, I didn't want to ignore this opportunity to discuss neurodiversity.

It's a complex landscape. A couple of paragraphs in this post is hardly the place to discuss that. So, if you take one thing away from this post, please be kind when someone says they self-identify as Neurodivergent/Autistic/ADHD/etc. If they are willing to face the unjust social and cultural stigma of self-identifying as one, receiving that in reasonable good faith is the smallest possible gesture of basic human decency, regardless of your own neurotype.

Now, back to the irregularly scheduled programming.

Understanding my neurodivergence was the best thing that happened to me. I could argue that becoming a father was better, but becoming a father was a conscious choice. Being neurodivergent wasn't something I chose. It's also not something I'd ever give up, even if that was an option. I was born neurodivergent. It merely took me all this time to realize I was. That realization was overwhelmingly cathartic and validating. Suddenly, I was not a defective normal person. It meant I am a perfectly normal neurodivergent person.

So, now that I have a not-so-insignificant amount of energy daily that could have been otherwise used to beat myself up, I can use it to deal with everything else in life.

For example, this blog was due for an update. Several posts needed revising or removal, and I wanted to make the posting process almost painless. Then, there were the domains to clean up. Like any self-respecting procrastinator working in tech, I had accumulated a few project ideas and their domain names. The life where I live can be a test every day, but that's true for most people living here. However, the burning hole in the wallet—complete with runes of the USD currency symbol—was my own doing. So, I listened to the arguments from both sides and got rid of everything that no longer sparked joy. There are a few ideas I've [started doing](https://gaveen.me/facets/asura) [something with](https://gaveen.me/facets/mayavee)—loosely speaking. Pointing them to a page here was more convenient than maintaining separate placeholders.

Therefore, it's a time as good as any to relaunch this site. I'm also re-organizing the content and updating a few things. But for the moment, that's all I have to say. I'm glad I got back here. See you again soon.
