Hey, it's been a while. How have you been? Four years is a long time.

In my defense, a lot happened in those four years. But there are already a million posts and podcasts about what the world went through during that time. There are at least a few about what people in Sri Lanka had to deal with. So, I won't go there. At least not now.

At the moment, all I want to say is: here I am now. I certainly want to write more often. Scratch that. I certainly want to post more often. I do write often. But it's not the kind of thing I feel anyone would find interesting enough to read. My old process of publishing a new post here had several manual steps due to how it was configured technically. While it wasn't particularly taxing, it usually became the straw that broke the back of the camel that was my blog post. Telling you about the numerous draft posts I discarded eventually serves no further purpose.

On top of everything above, the first three of the four years were an apt time to be very active on *Twitter*. Sometimes, it was for sharing intriguing technical articles and arguing with random strangers on the internet. Other times, Twitter was for news, emergency, activism, or political dissent. It was a time like that. But we lost that too. Twitter of the old days is no more. Our so-called digital town square was bought by an incompetent mayor. In short, my social media use right now is limited to Mastodon. Most people I wanted to hear from are also on Mastodon. It's also a more chilled place and a welcome change of pace. So there's that.

To top everything off, I've personally grown a bit during these few years. I obviously had to grow in my role as a father. But that's not exactly what I meant. Over the past couple of years, I was lucky enough to notice a few toxic traits I had picked up over time and started to be better. More importantly, I met my true self for the first time. It's a long story and a realization worthy of much elaboration in due time. But due to reasons, I can't do that freely just yet.

What I can share right now is that I am *neurodivergent*. That means I experience and process the world somewhat differently than most people. I don't mean that as a mental difference because no two people are exactly alike. *Neurodiversity* is another aspect of human life that acknowledges there are people with different neurological compositions. That doesn't sound overly complicated, right? Not quite.

If that sounded like a segue to go on a tangent, that's because it was. There might come a time when neurodiversity is acknowledged and celebrated as other forms of diversity, but we're not there by a long shot. For now, it translates to people of the majority neurotype being uncomfortable acknowledging the differences without pathologized descriptors and people with a diagnosis for such descriptors being uncomfortable accepting others like them without a formal diagnosis of Autism, ADHD, etc.

All neurotypes have people with disabilities, and people who are not of the majority neurotype are inherently disabled by a world that is intolerant of their differences. And then there are people like me who are good at masking their differences. Since they learned their behavior—without deception—by masking their differences, both their neurodivergence and their struggles are usually invisible to everyone else. Most masking neurodivergent people don't know the depth of their differences and often assume everyone else is also going through the same struggle with seemingly mundane things while managing seemingly more complex aspects of life. Even when things boil over as meltdowns and burnouts, their struggles are often seen as personal defects rather than the effects of being disabled by the world—often even without comprehending it.

We're only now beginning to understand neurodiversity better. We're only now beginning to see just how many masking neurodivergent people could be out there. For a vast majority of masking neurodivergent people, social media is the only way to learn from a diverse pool of lived experiences of people like them. If you see random people being angry about TikTok diagnosis and social media convincing people to claim Autism and ADHD, this is what they are uncomfortable about. I'm sure some people might mistake or even go as far as to fake having such a condition. But there's no way to negatively diagnose someone from social media posts, even if the critic can experience that neurological existence in the first place.

A vast majority of neurodivergent people don't watch a two-minute video and turn around to claim disability benefits or online clout. They spend months and months guessing and second-guessing if they could have autism, ADHD, etc., and researching every bit of information they could find. As a result, more people are gradually becoming aware of their neurodivergence and starting to self-identify as such. It's a complex landscape. A couple of paragraphs in this post is hardly the place to discuss that. So, if you take one thing away from this post, please be kind when someone says they are neurodivergent/Autistic/ADHD/etc. If they are willing to face the unjust social and cultural stigma of self-identifying as one, receiving that in reasonable good faith is the least basic human decency possible, regardless of your own neurotype.

It makes me profoundly sad whenever I think about how many generations upon generations of neurodivergent people struggled their entire lives without ever knowing why or how to articulate their existence. Therefore, I didn't want to ignore this opportunity to discuss neurodiversity. Now, back to the irregularly scheduled programming.

Understanding my neurodivergence (including the parts I'm deliberately omitting this time) was the best thing that happened to me. I could argue that becoming a father was better, but that was a conscious choice. Becoming neurodivergent wasn't something I chose. It's also not something I'd ever give up, even if that was an option. Everybody who knew me well (including myself) knew an authentic self without deception. I was born neurodivergent. It merely took me all this time to realize I was. Realizing it was overwhelmingly cathartic and validating. Suddenly, I was not a defective "normal person". It meant I am a "perfectly normal" neurodivergent person.

So, now that I have a not-so-insignificant amount of energy daily that would have been otherwise used solely to beat myself up, I can use it to deal with everything else in life. The life where I live can be a test every day, but that's true for most people living here. On a different note, I had a few accumulated domains and project ideas like any self-respecting procrastinator working in tech. I got rid of everything that no longer sparked joy. Honestly, the credit card bill burning a hole in my wallet in USD had a far more convincing argument than a few unrealized ideas with unknown potential. However, there are still a couple of ideas I've [started doing](https://gaveen.me/facets/asura) [something with](https://gaveen.me/facets/mayavee)—loosely speaking. Pointing them to a page here is more convenient than hosting separate placeholders. Besides, I also wanted to reduce the steps to publish a blog post.

Therefore, it's a time as good as any to relaunch this site. I'm re-organizing the content and removing a few things that felt out of place. But for the moment, I'm glad I got here. See you soon.
