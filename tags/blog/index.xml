      <description>Where should I begin? Is this on?
Hello there! Welcome, fellow human being, and of course, any other that is reading. This is presumably Gaveen, and—despite all my efforts—you have found my blog. If this is the choice of Steins;Gate, who am I to complain.
There are no grand introductions here, nor any road maps to unveil—just the simple realization to be had that I may have moved my blog yet another time.</description>
