      <description>There are some moments in life you lucidly remember, when the gears of cause and action in a chaotic universe turn, something clicks into place, and your life changes forever. If you are lucky—like I was—the changes it brings about can be good and profound.
Somewhere in late &amp;rsquo;90s I was a teenager trying to traverse self-expression, while trying to balance creative life and &amp;hellip;life. It was not a fight I felt was going my way.</description>

 Categories Tags   Can I subscribe only to a section of this blog? Yes. Each of the categories and tags will have its own feed.</description>

      <title>I thought I knew</title>

      <description>I thought I knew how being a father would be. I have a father, a good one. I understood that much. I have nephews and nieces, and I love them to bits. I understood that much. So when we become pregnant, I thought I had a pretty strong grip on how being a parent felt.
I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly ready as I wanted to be, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had a big gap of understanding on how a father felt about their child.</description>

      <description>I am a poet, and that much I can say without the uncertainty I allude in the current bio section of this blog which reads &amp;ldquo;SysAdmin, Programming Language Tourist, and Petty Dabbler of the Written Word&amp;rdquo;, or my first post here.
My work as a poet, or a writer is mainly to write. But, I write mainly for the sheer joy of reading it back, in every way I get to.</description>

      <description>Where should I begin? Is this on?
Hello there! Welcome, fellow human being, and of course, any other that is reading. This is presumably Gaveen, and—despite all my efforts—you have found my blog. If this is the choice of Steins;Gate, who am I to complain.
There are no grand introductions here, nor any road maps to unveil—just the simple realization to be had that I may have moved my blog yet another time.</description>
