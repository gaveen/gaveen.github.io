      <title>My Vim Story</title>

      <description>Once you have used &amp;rsquo;notepad.exe&amp;rsquo;, you have used all text editors—they said. A text editor is a text editor is a text editor—they said. After the first few years of running Linux/Unix professionally, I kind of subconsciously agreed with this idea, eventhough I knew Vim—I thought I knew Vim. But when other people who actually knew how to use Vim used it, Vim still looked like magic.
If you have worked in a command line at some point, I am sure you can appreciate the wisdom of learning how to use a text editing program properly.</description>

      <description>There are some moments in life you lucidly remember, when the gears of cause and action in a chaotic universe turn, something clicks into place, and your life changes forever. If you are lucky—like I was—the changes it brings about can be good and profound.
Somewhere in late &amp;rsquo;90s I was a teenager trying to traverse self-expression, while trying to balance creative life and &amp;hellip;life. It was not a fight I felt was going my way.</description>

      <description>Not many people have contacted me asking things about this blog. So, I&amp;rsquo;m placing these fabricated questions here to tell you a little more about a few things.
Who are you anyway? I&amp;rsquo;m Gaveen. The site introduction says I&amp;rsquo;m a SysAdmin, Programming Language Tourist, and Petty Dabbler of the Written Word, among other things.
My Mastodon profile (on Hachyderm.io) says I&amp;rsquo;m into Rust, Linux, Open Source, Mechanical Keyboards, Science, Technology, Poetry, Anime, DIY, and Mushrooms.</description>

      <title>I thought I knew</title>

      <description>I thought I knew how being a father would be. I have a father, a good one. I understood that much. I have nephews and nieces, and I love them to bits. I understood that much. So when we become pregnant, I thought I had a pretty strong grip on how being a parent felt.
I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly ready as I wanted to be, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had a big gap of understanding on how a father felt about their child.</description>

      <title>What is the meaning of that poem?</title>

      <description>I am a poet, and that much I can say without the uncertainty I allude in the current bio section of this blog which reads &amp;ldquo;SysAdmin, Programming Language Tourist, and Petty Dabbler of the Written Word&amp;rdquo;, or my first post here.
My work as a poet, or a writer is mainly to write. But, I write mainly for the sheer joy of reading it back, in every way I get to.</description>

      <description>Where should I begin? Is this on?
Hello there! Welcome, fellow human being, and of course, any other that is reading. This is presumably Gaveen, and—despite all my efforts—you have found my blog. If this is the choice of Steins;Gate, who am I to complain.
There are no grand introductions here, nor any road maps to unveil—just the simple realization to be had that I may have moved my blog yet another time.</description>
