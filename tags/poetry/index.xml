      <description>Today is the Sinhala (and Tamil) New Year day. As I sit in front of the computer to partake in my trade—as one does according to tradition—I want to try an answer a certain question.
Whatever happened to that book you were writing?—is not a question I have been asked too many times. You see, I am not a well-known writer at all—but I digress. I have in fact, been working for a while on at least two, maybe two and a half books—none of which are actually ready yet.</description>

      <description>I am a poet, and that much I can say without the uncertainty I allude in the current bio section of this blog which reads &amp;ldquo;SysAdmin, Programming Language Tourist, and Petty Dabbler of the Written Word&amp;rdquo;, or my first post here.
My work as a poet, or a writer is mainly to write. But, I write mainly for the sheer joy of reading it back, in every way I get to.</description>
