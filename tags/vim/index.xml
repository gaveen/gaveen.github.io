      <description>Once you have used &amp;lsquo;notepad.exe&amp;rsquo;, you have used all text editors—they said. A text editor is a text editor is a text editor—they said. After the first few years of running Linux/Unix professionally, I kind of subconsciously agreed with this idea, eventhough I knew Vim—I thought I knew Vim. But when other people who actually knew how to use Vim used it, Vim still looked like magic.
If you have worked in a command line at some point, I am sure you can appreciate the wisdom of learning how to use a text editing program properly.</description>
