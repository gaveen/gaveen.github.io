      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m early to work, because the roads are mostly empty. That&amp;rsquo;s not because of an extended holiday season. No, that finished last week. People are trying to stay home because of the Easter Sunday Attacksâ€”they are uncertain where to go from here.
As I type these words away, I&amp;rsquo;m but a walking distance away from Mahawela Gardens, where one gruesome episode of Sunday&amp;rsquo;s events took place. I also hear stories in the background about colleagues who have lost family members.</description>
